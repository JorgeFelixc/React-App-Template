# This is initial React Application Base

This project have the basis to make a react aplication, things like:
  - Global State hook (no need redux)
  - Theme Dark/Light (and to add more or change this ones)
  - Routes (you only change window.location.href or use href on <a></a> tag)
  - Notifications

In the Index page, you have a example how it use GlobalState and active notifications
and how change theme of the app.
